# Filtered Search

The filtered search component is responsible for managing search with possible filters.

## Usage

Each filter option (named token) requires a separate Vue component. `GlFilteredSearchToken` is an example of such a token.

Prepare array of available token configurations with the following fields:

- `type`: unique identifier of token type
- `title`: human-readable title of the token
- `icon`: token icon
- `token`: (optional) the token Vue component to use (e.g. `AuthorToken`)
- `dataType`: (optional) identifier of type (for example "user") for this filter. Tokens
  of the same type could be switched without losing their values
- `unique`: (optional) indicate this token could appear only once in the filter
- `disabled`: (optional) indicate this token should be hidden from the dropdown
- `operators`: (optional) an array of selectable operators.
  Each array item is an object that must contain `value` and `description`, and optionally `default`
  (e.g. `{ value: '=', description: 'is', default: 'true' }`)
- `multiSelect`: (optional) when `true`, the suggestions list becomes multi-select instead of single-select.
  It is discouraged to use this together with `unique`, as `unique` is intended for single-select.
- `options`: (optional) an array of options which the user can pick after the operator has been selected.
  The option object can have the following properties defined: `value`, `icon`, `text`, and `default` 
  all of which are expected be of type `string`. If the `default` is omitted, the `value` of the first 
  option will be displayed as a suggestion
- any additional fields required to configure your component

Each token for filtered search is a Vue component with the following props:

- `value`: an object with a `data` property containing the current value, and optionally an `operator` value containing the operator value
- `active`: indicates if the token is currently active. It's the token's responsibility
  to render proper control for editing (for example input).
- `current-value`: current tokens of the filtered search.
- `index`: current token position in the filtered search.
- `config`: additional configuration, supplied in filtered search config for this token.

The token should emit the following events:

- `activate`: when the token requests activation (for example, when being clicked).
- `deactivate`: when token requests deactivation (for example due to losing blur on input).
- `destroy`: when token requests self-destruction (for instance for clicking "X" sign).
- `replace`: token requests its replacement with another token.
- `split`: token requests adding string values after the current token.
- `complete`: token indicates its editing is completed.

## Examples

Define a list of available tokens:

```js
const availableTokens = [
  { type: 'static', icon: 'label', title: 'static:token', token: staticToken },
  { type: 'dynamic', icon: 'rocket', title: 'dynamic:~token', token: dynamicToken },
];
```

Pass the list of tokens to the search component. Optionally, you can use `v-model` to receive realtime updates:

```js
 <gl-filtered-search :available-tokens="tokens" v-model="value" />
```
