# GlCard

<!-- STORY -->

Cards are a flexible component used to display content and actions in a variety of contexts.
They are generally restricted to a single topic and it should be easy for users to scan relevant and
actionable information. Content, such as images and text, should be positioned within them in a
manner that demonstrates their intended hierarchy.
