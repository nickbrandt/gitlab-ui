/**
 * Composite utilities
 *
 * naming convention: gl-c-{name}
 * purpose: This is for composite classes that provide significant readability and maintainability profit.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE: When considering to abstract a set of utility classes, please prefer, in order:
 *   1. Not abstracting
 *   2. Create a component
 *   3. Create a constant scoped within a specific module
 *   4. Create a composite class if there are many preexisting occurrences with a clear design responsibility.
 *
 * notes: 
 *   - Composite classes should be very short and not have any nested rules.
