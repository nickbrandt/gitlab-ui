# Troubleshooting

## `yarn build -w` results a "JavaScript heap out of memory error"

Watching for changes in GitLab UI files can be memory intensive. You can increase the amount of
memory you can use to run the process.

```sh
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" yarn build -w
```

We are keeping track of this problem at <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/issues/614>

## Caching on GitLab CI

We are caching our `node_modules/` folder on GitLab CI. This should not lead to problems, as we
are basing the cache hash on:

- .gitlab-ci.yml
- yarn.lock

So any time our dependencies or CI config, we will create a new cache. The advantage of this is:
As long as these stay the same, we can cache even across branches!

In the unlikely event we are seeing build errors, the cache can be manually
[reset by maintainer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/caching/#clearing-the-cache-manually).

## I get an error when I run `yarn test:visual` locally

Running `yarn test:visual` (or `yarn test:visual:update`) locally will result in
error messages like this (even if you have Storybook running):

> Error when connecting to
> <http://localhost:9001/iframe.html?id=base-alert--default>, did you start or
> build the storybook first? A storybook instance should be running or a static
> version should be built when using puppeteer test feature.

Instead of updating the visual tests locally, trigger the manual
`update_screenshots` job in the `manual` stage of your MR's pipeline.

For more information, see [our documentation about visual
testing](visual_testing.md).
